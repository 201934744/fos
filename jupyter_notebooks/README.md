# Jupyter notebooks

You can use the Jupyter notebooks as normal. To use Ponq or daemon, simply import correct files and you can operate in standard mode. 
There are examples included in this directory for daemon and static accelerator usecase. 

How to launch jupyter notebooks:
- Open Chrome
- Go to `localhost:9090`
- Select `daemon_sobel_demo.ipynb` for daemon example or `ponq_mandelbrot_demo.ipynb` for static accelerator example
  - For daemon example please ensure daemon is running in background. 
- Select the box and press `shift + Enter` to run the code
