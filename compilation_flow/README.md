![compilation flow](./pr_flow/images/fig-flow.png)

In order to create the RTL description from your software follow the Phase 1 of [HLS tutorial](./hls/). Once you have the RTL description of your accelerator you can create a partial bitstream for it using the [tutorial PR flow](./pr_flow/) or continue with Phase 2 of [HLS tutorial](./hls/) for a static accelerator bitstream.
