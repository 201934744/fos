# FOS - FPGA Operating System Demo

FOS extends the ZUCL framework with linux integration and python runtime management to provide support for: multi-tenancy (concurrent processes with hardware accel.), dynamic offload, GUI, network connection and flexibility.

With FOS, you can develop accelerators in HLS as well as RTL and use them in standard full configuration mode, library mode for partially reconfigurable accelerators or daemon mode with dynamic reconfiguration. 

## Getting started

- Download SD Card image
- Set board to SD Card mode and turn it on

## Tutorials

- How to build HLS accelerators
- How to build RTL accelerators
- How to use Ponq
- How to use Ponq daemon
- How to compile partially reconfigurable modules
- How to build Linux (Pynq / Ubuntu) Image
