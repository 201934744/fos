# Using the Sobel HLS Module on your FPGA
## Introduction
From here on out we document how to use the HLS modules that are created using
[the following tutorial](../compilation_flow/hls/README.md).

In this tutorial, I describe how I went about using the Sobel module I created. This includes how I loaded the module onto the FPGA and the corresponding driver file.
